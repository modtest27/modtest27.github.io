      <![CDATA[<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><strong></strong>In the hustle and bustle of daily life, it's easy to overlook the simple yet profound act of self-care. Just as our beloved houseplants need regular watering to thrive, we too require consistent nourishment to flourish. The process of caring for plants offers a beautiful metaphor for tending to our own well-being. By drawing parallels between the needs of our plants and our personal self-care routines, we can uncover valuable insights into how to live a more balanced and fulfilling life.</p>
<p><strong>Consistency is Key</strong></p>
<p>Plants need a regular watering schedule to maintain their health. Too much water can lead to root rot, while too little can cause them to wither. Similarly, we thrive on consistency. Establishing a daily routine that includes time for relaxation, exercise, and proper nutrition can help us maintain our physical and mental health. Just as we wouldn't neglect our plants for days on end, we shouldn't neglect our own needs. Consistency in self-care practices is essential for long-term well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Listen to Your Needs</strong></p>
<p>Every plant has unique watering requirements based on its species, environment, and growth stage. A cactus might need water once a month, while a fern may need it every few days. Likewise, our personal needs can vary greatly from person to person and even change over time. It's important to listen to our bodies and minds, recognizing when we need rest, social interaction, or solitude. By being attuned to our needs, we can provide ourselves with the right kind of nourishment at the right time.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Matters</strong></p>
<p>The quality of water we give our plants can significantly impact their health. Using distilled or rainwater can prevent the buildup of harmful minerals that tap water might introduce. Similarly, the quality of what we consume—whether it’s food, media, or social interactions—affects our overall well-being. Choosing nutritious foods, engaging in positive activities, and surrounding ourselves with supportive people are ways to ensure we're "watering" ourselves with high-quality nourishment.</p>
<p><strong>Creating a Supportive Environment</strong></p>
<p>Plants thrive in environments that support their growth, which includes the right soil, light, and humidity levels. For us, a supportive environment means creating spaces that promote relaxation and joy. This might involve decluttering our living spaces, incorporating elements of nature, or designating areas for specific activities like reading, yoga, or meditation. Just as we carefully place our plants in optimal conditions, we should curate our surroundings to enhance our own growth and happiness.</p>
<p><strong>Patience and Growth</strong></p>
<p>Growth takes time, both for plants and ourselves. We may not see immediate results from our self-care efforts, just as a newly watered plant doesn’t instantly sprout new leaves. Patience is essential. By nurturing ourselves consistently, we gradually build resilience and strength. Over time, we’ll notice the positive effects of our efforts, much like the slow but steady growth of a well-cared-for plant.</p>
<p><strong>Celebrating Small Victories</strong></p>
<p>Every new leaf or bloom on a plant is a cause for celebration. These small victories are signs of health and progress. In our own lives, it's important to recognize and celebrate our achievements, no matter how minor they may seem. Whether it's finishing a book, completing a workout, or simply taking a moment to relax, acknowledging these victories reinforces our commitment to self-care and motivates us to continue nurturing ourselves.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the act of watering our plants serves as a powerful metaphor for self-care. By establishing consistency, listening to our needs, prioritizing quality, creating supportive environments, exercising patience, and celebrating small victories, we can ensure that both our plants and ourselves thrive. As we care for our leafy companions, let us be reminded of the importance of also tending to our own well-being, nurturing the growth that leads to a healthier, happier life.</p>]]>

<p>Fungus gnats can be a pesky problem for houseplant enthusiasts. These tiny, fly-like insects thrive in the moist soil of houseplants, feeding on organic matter and fungi. While adult fungus gnats are more of a nuisance than a threat, their larvae can cause significant damage to plant roots, leading to poor plant health. Thankfully, there are natural ways to tackle this problem. Here’s how you can get rid of fungus gnats in houseplants naturally, including the use of mosquito bits and sticky gnat traps.</p>
<h4>Understanding Fungus Gnats</h4>
<p>Before diving into solutions, it's important to understand a bit about fungus gnats. These small, dark-colored flies are often mistaken for fruit flies. They are attracted to damp soil and organic matter, where they lay their eggs. The larvae, which resemble tiny, white worms with black heads, feed on organic material in the soil, including plant roots. This feeding can damage young plants and seedlings, leading to stunted growth and even plant death.</p>
<h4>Natural Solutions to Get Rid of Fungus Gnats</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Drying Out the Soil</strong> Fungus gnats thrive in moist environments. One of the simplest ways to reduce their population is by allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Most houseplants can tolerate a bit of dryness, so try to let the top inch or so of soil dry out before watering again. This makes the environment less hospitable for fungus gnats to lay their eggs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mosquito Bits</strong> Mosquito bits are a highly effective, natural solution for controlling fungus gnats. These bits contain Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti), a bacterium that is toxic to insect larvae. Simply sprinkle the mosquito bits on the soil surface or mix them into the top layer of soil. When you water your plants, the Bti is released into the soil, where it is ingested by the fungus gnat larvae, effectively killing them. This method is safe for humans, pets, and plants, making it an excellent natural remedy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sticky Gnat Traps</strong> Sticky gnat traps are another effective tool in the battle against fungus gnats. These traps are coated with a sticky substance that captures adult gnats, preventing them from laying more eggs in the soil. Place the traps near the base of your plants or insert them into the soil to catch gnats as they emerge. Regularly check and replace the traps as needed to keep the gnat population under control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hydrogen Peroxide Solution</strong> A mild hydrogen peroxide solution can help eliminate fungus gnat larvae in the soil. Mix one part hydrogen peroxide (3% solution) with four parts water and water your plants with this mixture. The hydrogen peroxide kills the larvae on contact but breaks down into water and oxygen, making it safe for plants. Use this treatment sparingly to avoid harming beneficial soil organisms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cinnamon</strong> Cinnamon is a natural fungicide and can help reduce the fungi that fungus gnats feed on. Sprinkle ground cinnamon on the surface of the soil to create a less appealing environment for the gnats. While it won't kill the larvae, it can help to reduce their food source and discourage adult gnats from laying eggs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Neem Oil</strong> Neem oil is a natural insecticide that can disrupt the life cycle of fungus gnats. Mix neem oil with water according to the package instructions and water your plants with this solution. Neem oil can kill larvae and repel adult gnats, helping to reduce their population over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Repotting</strong> In severe infestations, repotting your plants with fresh soil can be an effective way to eliminate fungus gnats. Remove the plant from its pot, gently shake off as much old soil as possible, and repot it in a clean container with fresh, sterile potting mix. This can help break the life cycle of the gnats and give your plant a fresh start.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Fungus gnats can be a frustrating problem for houseplant lovers, but with these natural solutions, you can effectively manage and eliminate them. By drying out the soil, using mosquito bits, setting up sticky gnat traps, and incorporating other natural remedies, you can protect your plants and enjoy a gnat-free indoor garden. Remember, consistency is key, so keep up with these treatments to maintain a healthy, gnat-free environment for your beloved houseplants.</h4>

      <![CDATA[In the hustle and bustle of modern life, finding ways to enhance our wellness can be challenging. Amidst the myriad of wellness trends, there's one timeless, natural remedy that often goes unnoticed: plants. Integrating plants into your living space can significantly boost your physical, mental, and emotional well-being. Here’s how these green companions can aid you in improving your wellness.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>Purifying the Air: Breathing Easy</strong><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">Plants are natural air purifiers. They absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen through the process of photosynthesis. Some plants, such as the snake plant (Sansevieria) and spider plant (Chlorophytum comosum), are particularly effective at filtering harmful toxins like formaldehyde, benzene, and trichloroethylene from the air.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">Cleaner air means fewer pollutants to irritate your respiratory system, leading to better breathing and overall health. Improved air quality can also enhance cognitive function, reduce headaches, and promote better sleep, contributing to your overall sense of well-being.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>Reducing Stress and Anxiety: A Green Sanctuary</strong><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">The presence of plants can have a calming effect on your mind and body. Numerous studies have shown that spending time around plants, whether indoors or outdoors, can reduce stress and anxiety levels. The simple act of caring for plants can be meditative, providing a sense of purpose and accomplishment.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">Engaging in activities like watering, pruning, and repotting can be therapeutic, offering a break from the digital world and daily stresses. This hands-on interaction with nature helps to ground you, providing a moment of tranquility and mindfulness in your day.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>Boosting Mood and Creativity: A Splash of Green</strong><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">Plants can also elevate your mood and enhance creativity. The visual appeal of lush greenery and vibrant blooms can create a more aesthetically pleasing and inviting environment. This can make you feel happier and more relaxed in your space.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">Moreover, studies have shown that being around plants can stimulate creativity and improve concentration. Whether you're working from home or pursuing creative hobbies, having plants nearby can provide the mental boost you need to stay focused and inspired.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>Improving Productivity: Nature’s Efficiency Boost</strong><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">Incorporating plants into your workspace can lead to increased productivity. Research indicates that employees who work in environments with plants are more productive, take fewer sick days, and feel more satisfied with their jobs.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">The presence of plants can reduce mental fatigue and enhance attention span, helping you stay on task and complete your work more efficiently. Whether it’s a small potted plant on your desk or a green wall in your office, plants can transform your workspace into a more pleasant and productive area.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>Encouraging Physical Activity: Gardening Benefits</strong><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">If you have the space for it, gardening can be an excellent way to get some physical exercise. Digging, planting, weeding, and watering can all contribute to your physical fitness. Gardening activities provide a low-impact workout that can improve flexibility, strength, and cardiovascular health.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">Additionally, spending time outdoors in the garden exposes you to natural sunlight, which can boost your vitamin D levels, improving your bone health and immune function. This combination of physical activity and sunlight can greatly enhance your overall wellness.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>Enhancing Connection to Nature: Bringing the Outdoors In</strong><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">In our increasingly urbanized world, connecting with nature can be challenging. Bringing plants into your home allows you to create a personal oasis that bridges the gap between the indoors and the outdoors. This connection to nature, even in small doses, can have a profound impact on your mental and emotional well-being.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">Plants remind us of the natural world’s beauty and resilience, offering a sense of peace and continuity. This connection can help reduce feelings of isolation and promote a sense of belonging and contentment.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>Cultivating Wellness with Plants</strong><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">Incorporating plants into your living space is a simple yet powerful way to enhance your wellness. From purifying the air and reducing stress to boosting mood, creativity, and productivity, plants offer a wide range of benefits. Whether you’re an experienced gardener or just starting with a few houseplants, nurturing green life can bring you closer to nature and foster a sense of well-being.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">So, take a step towards a healthier, happier you by inviting plants into your life. Embrace the natural beauty and serenity they offer, and watch as your wellness flourishes in the presence of these green companions.]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>Aloe Vera, often referred to as the "plant of immortality," has been celebrated for centuries for its myriad of benefits. This succulent plant is not only a hardy, low-maintenance addition to your home but also a powerhouse of healing properties. Whether you’re a plant enthusiast or someone seeking natural remedies, Aloe Vera is a versatile and valuable plant to consider. Let’s explore the benefits of Aloe Vera both as a houseplant and a source of natural healing.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>Aloe Vera as a Houseplant: A Green Companion</strong><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>Easy to Grow and Maintain**</strong><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">Aloe Vera is one of the most forgiving plants, making it ideal for both novice and experienced gardeners. It thrives in a range of conditions but prefers bright, indirect sunlight and well-draining soil. Aloe Vera’s ability to store water in its leaves means it requires minimal watering, making it a perfect choice for busy individuals or those who tend to forget their plants occasionally.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>Air Purification</strong><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">Like many other houseplants, Aloe Vera helps to purify the air. It absorbs carbon dioxide and releases oxygen, improving the air quality in your home. Some studies suggest that Aloe Vera can also remove toxins such as formaldehyde and benzene from the air, making your living environment healthier.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>Aesthetic Appeal</strong><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">Aloe Vera has a distinctive, striking appearance that can enhance the aesthetic appeal of any space. Its thick, fleshy leaves with serrated edges provide a modern, minimalist look that complements various interior design styles. Whether placed in a sleek pot on your windowsill or as part of a succulent arrangement, Aloe Vera adds a touch of natural beauty to your home.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>Aloe Vera as a Healing Remedy: Nature’s Pharmacy</strong><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">1. Soothing Skin Irritations<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">Aloe Vera gel is renowned for its soothing properties, making it a popular remedy for skin irritations, including sunburn, minor cuts, and insect bites. The gel’s cooling effect provides instant relief, while its anti-inflammatory properties help reduce redness and swelling. Simply apply the gel directly from the leaf to the affected area for immediate comfort.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">2. Moisturizing and Hydrating<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">Aloe Vera is an excellent natural moisturizer. Its gel penetrates the skin easily, providing deep hydration without leaving a greasy residue. It’s suitable for all skin types, including sensitive and acne-prone skin. Regular use can help maintain smooth, hydrated skin and can be incorporated into your daily skincare routine.</p>
<p>3. Healing Wounds and Burns<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">The healing properties of Aloe Vera extend to wound care. Aloe Vera gel contains compounds such as polysaccharides and glycoproteins that promote skin regeneration and repair. Applying Aloe Vera to minor burns and wounds can accelerate the healing process, reduce the risk of infection, and minimize scarring.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">4. Digestive Health<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">Aloe Vera juice, derived from the inner leaf gel, can support digestive health. It is known to have a soothing effect on the gastrointestinal tract, helping to relieve conditions such as acid reflux, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and constipation. However, it’s important to consume Aloe Vera juice in moderation and consult with a healthcare professional before use.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">5. Boosting the Immune System<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">Aloe Vera is rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that can help strengthen the immune system. Its immune-boosting properties can help your body fight off infections and maintain overall health. Incorporating Aloe Vera into your diet, whether through supplements or Aloe Vera juice, can provide these benefits.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>Embrace the Benefits of Aloe Vera</strong><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">Aloe Vera stands out as a plant that offers both aesthetic and health benefits. Its easy care requirements make it a delightful addition to any home, while its extensive healing properties provide natural remedies for a variety of conditions. From soothing skin irritations and moisturizing the skin to promoting digestive health and boosting the immune system, Aloe Vera is truly a versatile and invaluable plant.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">By embracing Aloe Vera, you invite both beauty and wellness into your life. So, whether you’re looking to enhance your home’s decor or seeking natural healing solutions, Aloe Vera is a wonderful companion to consider. Explore the wonders of this remarkable plant and discover how it can improve your well-being, inside and out.</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[In a world that often feels hectic and overwhelming, the concept of wellness can be a beacon of hope and a path to balance. But what does wellness mean to you? For some, it might be a state of physical fitness, while for others, it could be a sense of mental peace or emotional stability. Understanding and nurturing your own wellness is a deeply personal journey, and there are many ways to cultivate it, including tending to plants, engaging in activities like yoga and meditation, and fostering an overall feeling of being grounded.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>Tending to Plants: Nurturing Growth and Greenery</strong><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">One often overlooked avenue to wellness is the simple act of tending to plants. Whether you have a sprawling garden or a few potted plants on your windowsill, the act of caring for greenery can have profound effects on your well-being. Gardening and plant care can reduce stress, improve mood, and provide a sense of accomplishment. Plants also purify the air, adding a touch of freshness to your living space.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">For example, caring for a <a href="https://feelgrounded.com/collections/pet-friendly-plants/products/peacock-plant" target="_blank">Peacock Plant</a>, with its vibrant leaf patterns and intricate unfurling process, can be a meditative practice. Watching a plant grow and thrive under your care fosters a connection to nature and a sense of grounding. This connection can help you feel more rooted and stable in your daily life.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>Engaging in Yoga and Meditation: Finding Inner Peace</strong><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">Activities like yoga and meditation are powerful tools for enhancing wellness. Yoga combines physical postures, breath control, and meditation to improve flexibility, strength, and mental clarity. It encourages mindfulness and a connection between body and mind, which can lead to a more balanced and centered life.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">Meditation, on the other hand, focuses on training the mind to achieve a state of calm and awareness. Regular meditation practice can reduce stress, improve focus, and promote emotional health. It’s a journey inward, helping you to tune out the noise of the external world and find peace within.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">By incorporating yoga and meditation into your routine, you can create a sanctuary of calm in your day, allowing you to reconnect with yourself and find a sense of inner peace.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>The Overall Feeling of Being Grounded: Connecting to the Present</strong><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">At the heart of wellness is the feeling of being grounded. This means being fully present in the moment, connected to your body, and aware of your surroundings. Being grounded is about finding stability and balance, even when life gets chaotic.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">There are many ways to cultivate this feeling. Simple practices like mindful breathing, spending time in nature, or engaging in activities that bring you joy can help you feel more connected and centered. For instance, taking a walk in the park, listening to the rustling leaves, and feeling the earth beneath your feet can be a grounding experience.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">Tending to plants, practicing yoga, and meditating are all ways to anchor yourself in the present moment. They remind you of the beauty in simplicity and the importance of nurturing both your environment and your inner self.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>Embracing Your Unique Path to Wellness</strong><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">Ultimately, wellness is a personal and evolving journey. What works for one person may not work for another. It’s important to explore different practices and find what resonates with you. Whether it’s the tranquility of a garden, the discipline of yoga, the stillness of meditation, or any other practice, what matters most is that it brings you a sense of peace, balance, and well-being.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">So, what does wellness mean to you? Take the time to explore, reflect, and nurture your own path to wellness. Embrace the practices that make you feel grounded, connected, and whole. In doing so, you’ll cultivate a richer, more fulfilling life.]]>

<li data-mce-fragment="1">
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">Exercise and Fitness</strong>: Gardening is a form of moderate-intensity exercise that can help improve physical fitness. Activities such as digging, planting, weeding, and watering involve various muscle groups, enhancing strength, endurance, and flexibility. Regular gardening can burn calories, aid in weight management, and reduce the risk of chronic illnesses like heart disease and diabetes.</p>
</li>
<li data-mce-fragment="1">
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">Improved Immunity</strong>: Spending time outdoors in the garden exposes you to fresh air and sunlight, which are essential for boosting the immune system.

</li>
<li data-mce-fragment="1">
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">Enhanced Nutrition</strong>: Growing your own fruits, vegetables, and herbs ensures access to fresh, organic produce.

</li>
<li data-mce-fragment="1">
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">Mindfulness and Focus</strong>: Gardening encourages mindfulness, the practice of being present in the moment.

This mindful engagement can improve cognitive function and provide a sense of clarity and peace.</p>
</li>
<li data-mce-fragment="1">
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">Connection to Nature</strong>: In our technology-driven world, gardening offers a way to reconnect with nature.

Whether it's listening to the birds, feeling the soil, or watching plants grow, these interactions with nature can be profoundly grounding and nurturing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1">Social Benefits</h3>
<ol data-mce-fragment="1">
<li data-mce-fragment="1">
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">Community Building</strong>: Gardening can also be a social activity, bringing people together in community gardens or gardening clubs.

</li>
<li data-mce-fragment="1">
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">Educational Opportunities</strong>: Gardening provides opportunities for lifelong learning.

<ul data-mce-fragment="1">
<li data-mce-fragment="1">
<strong data-mce-fragment="1">Choose Your Space</strong>: Whether you have a backyard, a balcony, or a windowsill, you can start a garden. Container gardening is a great option for small spaces.</li>
<li data-mce-fragment="1">
<strong data-mce-fragment="1">Select Your Plants</strong>: Choose plants that are suitable for your climate and space. Start with easy-to-grow plants like herbs, tomatoes, or succulents.</li>
<li data-mce-fragment="1">
<strong data-mce-fragment="1">Gather Supplies</strong>: Basic gardening tools, quality soil, and appropriate containers are essential. Local gardening centers or online resources can provide guidance on what you need.</li>

<p data-mce-fragment="1">As concerns about environmental sustainability grow, gardeners and plant enthusiasts are increasingly looking for eco-friendly ways to care for their green spaces. One such method is harvesting and utilizing rainwater. This not only conserves water but also provides plants with a natural, nutrient-rich source of hydration. In this blog, we'll explore the benefits of using rainwater, how to harvest it effectively, and the best practices for using it on your plants.</p>
<h4 data-mce-fragment="1">The Benefits of Using Rainwater</h4>
<ol data-mce-fragment="1">
<li data-mce-fragment="1">
<strong data-mce-fragment="1">Environmental Impact</strong>: By collecting rainwater, you reduce the demand on municipal water supplies and lower your water bill. It's a sustainable practice that helps conserve a precious resource.</li>
<li data-mce-fragment="1">
<strong data-mce-fragment="1">Nutrient-Rich</strong>: Unlike tap water, rainwater is free of chemicals like chlorine and fluoride. It also contains nitrogen and other nutrients that can promote healthy plant growth.</li>
<li data-mce-fragment="1">
<strong data-mce-fragment="1">Soil Health</strong>: Rainwater is naturally soft, which can prevent the buildup of salts in the soil. This helps maintain soil structure and fertility, benefiting your plants in the long run.</li>
</ol>
<h4 data-mce-fragment="1">How to Harvest Rainwater</h4>
<ol data-mce-fragment="1">
<li data-mce-fragment="1">
<strong data-mce-fragment="1">Choosing a System</strong>: There are various rainwater harvesting systems available, from simple rain barrels to more complex systems with pumps and filtration. Choose one that fits your needs and budget.</li>
<li data-mce-fragment="1">
<strong data-mce-fragment="1">Placement</strong>: Position your rain barrel or collection system under a downspout to capture runoff from your roof. Ensure the system is elevated slightly to make accessing the water easier.</li>
<li data-mce-fragment="1">
<strong data-mce-fragment="1">Maintenance</strong>: Keep your collection system clean by removing debris from the roof and gutters. Regularly check for any leaks or damage to ensure efficient water collection.</li>
</ol>
<h4 data-mce-fragment="1">Utilizing Rainwater for Your Plants</h4>
<ol data-mce-fragment="1">
<li data-mce-fragment="1">
<strong data-mce-fragment="1">Watering Schedule</strong>: Use rainwater to supplement your regular watering routine. It's especially beneficial during dry periods or droughts.</li>
<li data-mce-fragment="1">
<strong data-mce-fragment="1">Direct Application</strong>: You can use a watering can or hose attachment to apply rainwater directly to the soil. Avoid wetting the leaves too much, as this can encourage fungal growth.</li>
<li data-mce-fragment="1">
<strong data-mce-fragment="1">Storage</strong>: If you have a large rainwater harvesting system, consider using storage tanks to keep a reserve for drier times. Make sure the storage is covered to prevent algae growth and mosquito breeding.</li>
</ol>
<h4 data-mce-fragment="1">Tips for Effective Rainwater Use</h4>
<ol data-mce-fragment="1">
<li data-mce-fragment="1">
<strong data-mce-fragment="1">Monitor Rainfall</strong>: Keep track of local weather patterns and rainfall amounts. This will help you know when to harvest and use the rainwater.</li>
<li data-mce-fragment="1">
<strong data-mce-fragment="1">Filter if Needed</strong>: If your area has high levels of air pollution, consider filtering the rainwater before using it on edible plants to remove any contaminants.</li>
</ol>
<h4 data-mce-fragment="1">Harvesting and utilizing rainwater is a simple yet impactful way to nurture your plants while promoting environmental sustainability. By following these guidelines, you can ensure your garden thrives with this natural, eco-friendly resource. Start collecting rainwater today and see the difference it makes for your plants and the planet.</h4>]]>

      <![CDATA[<meta charset="utf-8">
<p data-mce-fragment="1">In an increasingly fast-paced and technology-driven world, the importance of reconnecting with nature for mental well-being cannot be overstated. From serene forest walks to basking in the sun's warmth, nature offers a sanctuary for the mind, body, and soul. But what exactly is the science behind this profound connection between nature and mental health? Let's delve deeper into the research to uncover the fascinating insights behind the impact of nature on mental well-being.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">The Biophilia Hypothesis: At the heart of the connection between nature and mental health lies the biophilia hypothesis, proposed by biologist Edward O. Wilson. This theory suggests that humans possess an innate affinity for nature, rooted in our evolutionary history. Throughout millennia, our ancestors thrived in natural environments, and as a result, we are biologically predisposed to seek out and feel drawn to natural landscapes. This deep-seated connection to nature forms the foundation of its therapeutic effects on our mental health.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Stress Reduction and Relaxation: One of the most well-documented benefits of nature on mental health is its ability to reduce stress and induce relaxation. Research has shown that spending time in natural settings, such as parks, forests, or gardens, can lower cortisol levels, the body's primary stress hormone. The gentle rustle of leaves, the soothing sound of flowing water, and the fresh scent of pine trees all work together to calm the nervous system and promote a sense of tranquility.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Improved Mood and Emotional Well-being: In addition to stress reduction, nature has been found to positively impact mood and emotional well-being. Studies have shown that exposure to natural environments can elevate mood, increase feelings of happiness, and reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. The presence of greenery and natural light stimulates the release of mood-boosting neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine, leading to a greater sense of joy and contentment.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Cognitive Restoration: Beyond its immediate effects on mood and stress levels, nature also plays a crucial role in cognitive restoration. In today's hyper-connected world, our attention is constantly pulled in multiple directions, leading to mental fatigue and cognitive overload. However, spending time in natural settings allows our brains to enter a state of "soft fascination," where our attention is effortlessly drawn to the sights, sounds, and textures of the natural world. This restorative experience replenishes mental resources, improves focus and concentration, and enhances creativity and problem-solving skills.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Social Connection and Community: Finally, nature provides a powerful platform for social connection and community building, which are essential for overall mental well-being. Whether through group hikes, community gardening projects, or outdoor recreational activities, nature brings people together, fostering a sense of belonging and camaraderie. These shared experiences not only strengthen social bonds but also provide opportunities for mutual support, empathy, and connection with others.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Conclusion: As we navigate the complexities of modern life, it's crucial to recognize the profound impact that nature has on our mental health and well-being. From reducing stress and improving mood to enhancing cognitive function and fostering social connection, the benefits of spending time in nature are manifold. By prioritizing our relationship with the natural world and incorporating nature-based activities into our daily lives, we can nurture our mental health and cultivate a greater sense of balance, resilience, and vitality.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Through science-backed research and personal anecdotes, this blog explores the multifaceted relationship between nature and mental health, highlighting the transformative power of nature in promoting emotional well-being and overall life satisfaction.</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">In the hustle and bustle of modern life, it's easy to feel disconnected from nature. We rush from one task to the next, immersed in the chaos of everyday living. But amidst this frenzy, there lies a simple yet powerful antidote: greenery. Whether it's a potted plant on your desk or a lush indoor garden in your home, bringing more greenery into your space can have profound effects on your well-being and sense of groundedness.</span></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">At its core, feeling grounded is about finding a sense of stability and connection with the earth. It's about anchoring ourselves in the present moment and cultivating a deeper awareness of our surroundings. And what better way to do that than by surrounding ourselves with the beauty of nature?</span></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">Plants have a remarkable ability to soothe the soul and uplift the spirit. Studies have shown that spending time in nature or even just being around plants can reduce stress, boost mood, and improve overall mental well-being. But you don't need to venture into the wilderness to reap these benefits – you can bring the outdoors in by incorporating greenery into your living spaces.</span></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">One of the most wonderful things about plants is their diversity. From towering palms to delicate ferns, there's a plant for every space and personality. Whether you have a green thumb or are new to plant parenting, there's something deeply satisfying about nurturing a living thing and watching it thrive.</span></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">But the benefits of greenery extend beyond aesthetics. Plants also have practical benefits, such as purifying the air and increasing humidity levels, which can improve respiratory health and create a more comfortable indoor environment. Plus, caring for plants can be a meditative practice, providing an opportunity to slow down, be present, and cultivate mindfulness.</span></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">So how can you incorporate more greenery into your space? Start small with a few easy-to-care-for houseplants like <a href="https://feelgrounded.com/collections/beginner-friendly-plants/products/golden-pothos">pothos</a>, <a href="https://feelgrounded.com/collections/beginner-friendly-plants/products/sansevieria-zeylanica">snake plants</a>, or<a href="https://feelgrounded.com/products/jade-plant?_pos=2&amp;_psq=jade&amp;_ss=e&amp;_v=1.0"> jade plants</a>. As you become more comfortable caring for them, you can gradually expand your collection and experiment with different varieties.</span></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">Don't have a green thumb? No problem! There are plenty of low-maintenance plants that require minimal care and attention. And if you're short on space, consider vertical gardening or hanging plants to make the most of limited square footage.</span></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">Ultimately, the key is to find what works for you and your space. Whether you're creating a lush jungle oasis or simply adding a few leafy accents here and there, the important thing is to bring a little piece of nature into your home and embrace the grounding energy it provides.</span></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">So go ahead – let your space come alive with the vibrant energy of greenery. Embrace grounded living and reconnect with the natural world right at your fingertips. Your mind, body, and soul will thank you for it.</span></p>

<p data-mce-fragment="1">In our fast-paced modern world, it's easy to become disconnected from nature and overlook the importance of sustainability in our daily lives. However, fostering a deeper connection with the natural world and embracing sustainable practices can have profound benefits for our overall well-being. From reducing stress and anxiety to promoting physical health and fostering a sense of purpose, here are some of the wellness benefits of being more connected to nature and embracing sustainability:</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">1. Stress Reduction</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Spending time in nature has been shown to reduce stress levels and promote relaxation. The sights, sounds, and smells of the outdoors can help calm the mind and soothe the spirit, providing a much-needed respite from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. By immersing ourselves in natural environments, we can experience a sense of tranquility and inner peace that can positively impact our mental and emotional well-being.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">2. Improved Mental Health</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Studies have found that spending time in nature is associated with improved mental health outcomes, including reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety. Connecting with nature allows us to escape the pressures of modern living and gain perspective on our problems and worries. Whether it's taking a leisurely walk in the park, gardening in the backyard, or simply gazing at the stars on a clear night, nature has a unique ability to uplift our spirits and boost our mood.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">3. Physical Health Benefits</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">In addition to its mental health benefits, spending time in nature can also improve physical health. Outdoor activities such as hiking, gardening, and cycling provide opportunities for exercise and movement, helping to strengthen muscles, improve cardiovascular health, and boost overall fitness levels.

Engaging in sustainable living practices can also bring us closer to like-minded individuals who share our values and commitment to environmental stewardship.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">5. Sense of Purpose</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Living in harmony with nature and adopting sustainable practices can provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment in our lives. By aligning our actions with our values and making choices that prioritize the health of the planet, we can find meaning and satisfaction in knowing that we are making a positive impact on the world around us. Whether it's tending to a garden, participating in conservation efforts, or advocating for environmental justice, each small act of sustainability contributes to a larger collective effort to create a better, more sustainable world.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">Embracing Nature and Sustainability for Wellness</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Incorporating nature and sustainability into our lives offers a myriad of wellness benefits, from reducing stress and anxiety to promoting physical health and fostering a sense of purpose. By reconnecting with the natural world and embracing sustainable practices, we not only improve our own well-being but also contribute to the health and vitality of the planet. Let's prioritize our connection to nature and commit to living more sustainably for the benefit of ourselves, future generations, and the Earth as a whole.</p>]]>

<p data-mce-fragment="1">In our quest for healthier, more vibrant houseplants, it's easy to overlook the impact of the products we use to care for them. Many commercially available fertilizers, pesticides, and cleaning solutions contain harsh chemicals that can harm both our plants and the environment. Fortunately, there's a wealth of natural alternatives readily available in our homes that can nurture our houseplants while minimizing our ecological footprint. Let's explore some eco-friendly household products that can promote greener growth and thriving indoor greenery.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">1. Banana Peel Fertilizer</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Banana peels are rich in potassium, phosphorus, and other nutrients that are beneficial for plant growth. Instead of tossing them in the trash, repurpose banana peels by turning them into a nutrient-rich fertilizer for your houseplants. Simply chop up banana peels and bury them in the soil around your plants. Over time, the peels will decompose, releasing essential nutrients that promote healthy growth and vibrant foliage.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">2. Epsom Salt</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Epsom salt is a versatile natural remedy that can benefit houseplants in several ways. Rich in magnesium and sulfur, Epsom salt can improve soil quality, promote nutrient absorption, and boost overall plant health. Dissolve a tablespoon of Epsom salt in a gallon of water and use it to water your plants once a month. Alternatively, sprinkle a small amount of Epsom salt directly onto the soil to provide a nutrient boost.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">3. Neem Oil</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Neem oil is a natural insecticide and fungicide derived from the seeds of the neem tree. It's effective at controlling pests such as aphids, spider mites, and whiteflies while also preventing fungal diseases like powdery mildew and black spot. Dilute neem oil with water according to the package instructions and apply it to your plants using a spray bottle. Be sure to cover both the tops and bottoms of the leaves for thorough protection.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">4. Vinegar</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">White vinegar is a powerful natural cleaner that can also benefit houseplants. Mix equal parts white vinegar and water to create a gentle cleaning solution that can be used to wipe down plant leaves, removing dust, dirt, and residue. Vinegar can also help lower the pH of alkaline soil, making it more acidic for plants that prefer slightly acidic growing conditions.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">5. Coffee Grounds</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Used coffee grounds are a valuable resource that can be repurposed as a natural fertilizer for houseplants. Coffee grounds are rich in nitrogen, which promotes healthy leaf growth and vibrant foliage. Simply sprinkle coffee grounds onto the soil surface or mix them into the soil to provide a nutrient boost for your plants. Avoid overdoing it, as excessive coffee grounds can increase soil acidity over time.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">Conclusion: Embracing Nature's Remedies</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Incorporating natural household products into your houseplant care routine is not only environmentally friendly but also beneficial for the health and vitality of your indoor greenery. By harnessing the power of banana peels, Epsom salt, neem oil, vinegar, and coffee grounds, you can nurture your houseplants naturally while minimizing your ecological footprint. Let's embrace nature's remedies and cultivate a greener, more sustainable approach to indoor gardening.</p>]]>

<p data-mce-fragment="1">In a world where environmental concerns are becoming increasingly urgent, the need for sustainable living practices has never been more crucial. While Earth Week serves as a reminder of our collective responsibility to protect the planet, true change requires ongoing commitment beyond a single week of celebration. By incorporating practical sustainability measures into our daily lives, we can make every week Earth Week and work towards building a greener, more sustainable future for generations to come.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">1. Reduce, Reuse, Recycle</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">The mantra of "reduce, reuse, recycle" remains a cornerstone of sustainable living. Start by minimizing waste in your daily routines, opting for reusable items like water bottles, shopping bags, and containers. Embrace the concept of upcycling by finding creative ways to repurpose household items instead of discarding them. And, of course, make recycling a habit by properly sorting and disposing of recyclable materials.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">2. Conserve Energy</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Energy conservation plays a vital role in reducing our carbon footprint. Simple steps such as turning off lights when not in use, unplugging electronics, and using energy-efficient appliances can significantly lower energy consumption. Consider installing programmable thermostats and LED light bulbs to further reduce energy usage and save on utility bills.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">3. Adopt Sustainable Transportation Practices</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Transportation is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Whenever possible, opt for eco-friendly modes of transportation such as walking, biking, carpooling, or using public transit. Consider investing in electric or hybrid vehicles for longer commutes and prioritize fuel-efficient driving habits to minimize your carbon footprint on the road.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">4. Support Local and Sustainable Agriculture</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Supporting local and sustainable agriculture is another impactful way to promote a greener future. Choose locally grown and organic produce whenever possible, reducing the carbon emissions associated with long-distance transportation and supporting environmentally friendly farming practices. Consider joining a community-supported agriculture (CSA) program or starting a backyard garden to further reduce your reliance on industrial agriculture.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">5. Advocate for Change</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Advocacy is a powerful tool for driving systemic change. Educate yourself about environmental issues and advocate for policies and initiatives that promote sustainability at the local, national, and global levels. Support environmental organizations and participate in community events and initiatives aimed at protecting the planet and advocating for environmental justice.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">6. Educate and Inspire Others</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">One person's actions may seem small, but collective efforts can create significant impact. Share your knowledge and passion for sustainability with friends, family, and colleagues, inspiring others to adopt eco-friendly practices in their own lives. Lead by example and encourage others to join you in making every week Earth Week.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">Embracing a Sustainable Lifestyle</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">As we strive to build a sustainable future, it's essential to recognize that every action, no matter how small, contributes to the larger goal of environmental preservation. By incorporating practical sustainability measures into our daily lives and making every week Earth Week, we can collectively work towards a greener, more sustainable future for our planet and all its inhabitants. Together, let's commit to building a world where sustainability is not just a choice but a way of life.</p>]]>

<p>As the days grow longer and the warmth of spring beckons, it's the perfect time to give your houseplants some much-needed TLC. Just like we freshen up our homes during spring cleaning, our indoor green companions also benefit from a little rejuvenation. In this guide, we'll explore the essential steps of spring cleaning for houseplants, including repotting, pruning, and refreshing soil, to ensure they thrive throughout the season.</p>
<p><strong>Repotting: Giving Your Plants Room to Grow</strong></p>
<p>One of the first tasks in spring cleaning for houseplants is repotting. Over time, plants outgrow their pots, leading to root congestion and restricted growth. Begin by carefully removing the plant from its current pot, gently teasing out the roots to loosen compacted soil. Inspect the roots for signs of rot or overcrowding, trimming away any damaged or circling roots with sterile scissors.</p>
<p>Choose a new pot that is one size larger than the current one, ensuring it has drainage holes to prevent waterlogging. Fill the bottom of the pot with fresh potting mix, then place the plant in the center, adding more soil around the sides until the roots are covered. Water the plant thoroughly and place it in a bright, indirect light location to allow it to settle into its new home.</p>
<p><strong>Pruning: Trimming for Health and Aesthetics</strong></p>
<p>Pruning is another essential aspect of spring cleaning for houseplants, helping to promote healthy growth and maintain a tidy appearance. Start by inspecting the plant for any dead, yellowing, or leggy growth, as well as any crossing or overcrowded branches. Use clean, sharp pruning shears to carefully remove these unwanted parts, making clean cuts just above a leaf node or bud.</p>
<p>Additionally, consider shaping the plant to encourage bushier growth or remove any damaged or diseased foliage. Regular pruning not only improves the plant's appearance but also allows for better air circulation and light penetration, reducing the risk of pests and diseases.</p>
<p><strong>Refreshing Soil: Nourishing Your Plants from the Ground Up</strong></p>
<p>Finally, spring cleaning for houseplants wouldn't be complete without refreshing the soil. Over time, potting mix can become compacted and depleted of nutrients, hindering plant growth and health. Remove the top layer of soil from the pot, along with any accumulated debris or old mulch.</p>
<p>Mix fresh potting mix with a slow-release fertilizer to replenish nutrients and improve soil structure. Fill the pot with the new soil mixture, leaving enough space at the top to water the plant without overflowing. Water the plant thoroughly, allowing excess water to drain away, and place it back in its usual spot.</p>
<p><strong>Embracing Renewal and Growth</strong></p>
<p>Spring cleaning for houseplants is a rewarding endeavor that not only revitalizes your indoor greenery but also fosters a deeper connection with nature. By repotting, pruning, and refreshing soil, you're providing your plants with the care and attention they need to thrive throughout the season and beyond. So, roll up your sleeves, grab your gardening tools, and get ready to usher in a season of renewed vitality and growth for your beloved houseplants. </p>

<p data-mce-fragment="1">As the vibrant colors of spring burst forth and the air fills with the sweet scent of blooming flowers, there's no denying the rejuvenating energy that this season brings. Spring offers us an opportunity to reconnect with nature and embrace its healing power. In this blog, we'll explore mindful practices that can help you cultivate a deeper connection with the natural world and experience the transformative benefits of springtime.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">Embrace Mindful Observation</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">One of the simplest yet most profound ways to connect with nature is through mindful observation. Take a leisurely stroll through a nearby park or woodland area, and allow yourself to fully immerse in the sights, sounds, and sensations of spring. Notice the delicate petals of blossoming flowers, the gentle rustle of leaves in the breeze, and the warmth of the sun on your skin. By being fully present in the moment, you can cultivate a sense of peace and appreciation for the beauty that surrounds you.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">Practice Grounding Techniques</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Grounding techniques involve connecting with the earth's energy to promote feelings of stability and balance. Take off your shoes and stand barefoot on the grass or soil, feeling the earth beneath your feet. Close your eyes and visualize roots extending from your body deep into the ground, anchoring you to the earth's core. Take slow, deep breaths, allowing yourself to feel grounded and supported by the earth's energy. This practice can help alleviate stress and anxiety while fostering a sense of calm and inner strength.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">Engage in Outdoor Meditation</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Spring provides the perfect backdrop for outdoor meditation, allowing you to harness the healing power of nature while cultivating inner peace and clarity. Find a quiet spot in nature—a tranquil garden, a peaceful forest clearing, or a serene lakeside—and settle into a comfortable position. Close your eyes and focus on your breath, allowing yourself to relax and let go of any tension or worries. As you meditate, tune into the sounds of nature around you—the chirping of birds, the rustling of leaves, the babbling of a nearby stream. Allow these natural sounds to guide you deeper into a state of relaxation and mindfulness.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">Connect with Plants and Wildlife</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Spring is a time of abundant growth and renewal, making it the perfect opportunity to connect with the plant and animal life around you. Spend time in your garden, nurturing new growth and observing the intricate beauty of plants as they awaken from their winter slumber. Set up a bird feeder or bird bath in your yard to attract feathered visitors and enjoy the sight of colorful songbirds flitting about. By fostering a sense of connection with the natural world, you can experience a profound sense of joy and interconnectedness.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">Express Gratitude</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">As you immerse yourself in the beauty of spring, take a moment to express gratitude for the abundance of life that surrounds you.

<p>In the hustle and bustle of our daily lives, it's easy to overlook the profound connection we share with the natural world. Amid the concrete jungles and digital landscapes, our potted companions, our leafy confidants, silently stand witness to our triumphs and challenges. In this blog, we delve into the introspective journey of how we can see ourselves in our plants and the mutual care that blossoms from this unique relationship.</p>
<h3><strong>The Shared Rhythms of Growth:</strong></h3>
<p>Our lives, much like the cycles of plants, are marked by seasons of growth, dormancy, and rejuvenation. As we witness a tiny seed evolving into a lush green entity, we are reminded of our own journeys—from the tentative steps of youth to the full bloom of maturity. The daily act of nurturing a plant becomes a mirror reflecting the symbiotic relationship between our own personal growth and the vitality of our leafy companions.</p>
<h3><strong>Learning from Resilience:</strong></h3>
<p>Plants, resilient by nature, teach us invaluable lessons about adaptation and resilience. In times of adversity, they stand tall, bending but not breaking. Similarly, as caregivers, we draw strength from their tenacity. The shared experience of weathering storms—both literal and metaphorical—creates a bond that transcends the barrier between us and our green allies.</p>
<h3><strong>Patience and the Art of Waiting:</strong></h3>
<p>In the realm of plant care, patience is a virtue. Seeds don’t sprout overnight, and buds take their sweet time to unfurl. As we navigate the ebb and flow of our lives, our plants become gentle reminders to embrace the art of waiting. The daily observation of slow but steady progress cultivates a sense of tranquility and acceptance within us.</p>
<h3><strong>Caring as a Form of Self-Care:</strong></h3>
<p>The act of caring for our plants can be a therapeutic ritual—a form of self-care that extends beyond our own well-being. The mindful watering, pruning, and repotting become moments of introspection, allowing us to recalibrate our own needs and cultivate a sense of purpose.</p>
<h3><strong>Symbolism in Greenery:</strong></h3>
<p>Plants, often laden with symbolism, mirror our emotions and experiences. The resilient succulent reflects our ability to thrive in arid circumstances, while a blooming orchid embodies the beauty that can emerge from patience and nurturing. By recognizing these symbols, we open a dialogue with ourselves, exploring the depths of our emotions and aspirations.</p>
<h3><strong>The Rituals of Care:</strong></h3>
<p>Daily or weekly, the rituals of plant care become a ritual of self-reflection. What do the yellowing leaves signify? Is it time for a change of soil, a shift in sunlight exposure, or perhaps a moment of introspection in our own lives? These moments of contemplation bridge the gap between us and our plants, creating a shared narrative.</p>
<h3><strong>Cultivating Mindfulness Through Greenery:</strong></h3>
<p>As we kneel beside our plants, tending to their needs, we engage in a form of mindfulness. The tactile experience of soil, the scent of leaves, and the visual feast of greenery become a grounding practice. In this shared stillness, we find ourselves more attuned to the present moment.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the journey of seeing ourselves in our plants is a voyage of self-discovery and mutual growth. By nurturing these botanical companions, we cultivate not only a thriving indoor garden but also a deeper understanding of our own lives. The care we extend to our plants is a reflection of the care we deserve, fostering a harmonious dance between us and the greenery that graces our living spaces. So, let us water, let us prune, and let us grow together—both in our homes and within ourselves.</p>

<p>As the seasons change and the days grow shorter, many individuals find themselves grappling with the effects of seasonal depression. Commonly known as Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), this condition can cast a shadow over the joy that the changing seasons often bring. We understand that these days can feel especially gray and lonely - sometimes we simply need reminders of what we can do to take care of ourselves. </p>
<p> </p>
<strong>Alternatives to Real Vitamin D:</strong> If you aren't in a position to get sunlight very often, look into taking supplements that help brain function such as Vitamin D, B12, and Magnesium. You can also purchase a therapy lamp, which mimics sunlight and is recommend for daily use when dealing with Seasonal Depression. <br>
<p> </p>
<strong>Create an Ideal Indoor Environment: </strong>Being indoors more doesn't have to feel dreadful or boring. Turn your place into a cozy haven for you to relax, unwind, and get inspired. <strong><br></strong>
<ul>
<li>Purchase color-changing lights to set an ambience</li>
<li>Find new teas, coffees, mulled wines, and warm drinks to rotate</li>
<li>Seek comforting activities, like yoga, reading, or binging your favorite show</li>
<li>Invest in a weighted blanket, oil diffuser, or candles </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Prioritize Outdoor Activities:</strong> Despite the chilled air, make a conscious effort to spend time outdoors when possible. Find the warmest hour of the day and indulge in a brief walk. Connecting with the outdoors and being in nature - even just being amongst the trees planted on a city block - can do wonders for mental health. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Stay Active:</strong> Physical activity is a powerful antidote to depression and aids in connecting us with our bodies. Engage in activities you enjoy, whether it's jogging, yoga, or dancing. Regular exercise releases endorphins, the body's natural mood lifters, and can significantly contribute to managing seasonal depression.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Establish a Routine:</strong> Maintaining a consistent routine can provide a sense of stability and control. Set regular wake-up and bedtime hours, plan meals, and schedule activities. Having a structure in your day can help combat the feelings of lethargy and disorientation that often accompany seasonal depression. If you don't already, consider adding mindfulness practices into your routine (such as breathing or affirmations). </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Connect with Others:</strong> Isolation can exacerbate the symptoms of seasonal depression. Make an effort to maintain social connections, whether through in-person interactions or virtual means. Schedule regular gatherings with friends or family, or join clubs or classes to meet new people. Social support is a crucial element in combating seasonal depression.</p>
<p><br><strong>Seek Professional Help or Medication:</strong> Sometimes we just need a bit of extra support to get us through. Therapy, counseling, and medication may be recommended to help manage seasonal depression. Seeking help is admirable </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Seasonal depression can cast a shadow on the brightest of days, but you're not alone. With a supportive environment and being vulnerable with others, it's possible to navigate through these challenging times. By incorporating these tips into your daily life, you can embrace the light and find joy even during the darkest seasons. Remember, you are not alone, and help is always available.</p>]]>

<p data-mce-fragment="1">Winter brings a set of challenges for beloved indoor houseplants.

<p data-mce-fragment="1">Winter brings a set of challenges for beloved indoor houseplants. On top of adjusting your care routine, the combination of chilled temps, less sunlight, and dry indoor air can lead to stress fairly quickly. Let's explore the signs of winter stress in indoor houseplants, along with tips on how to support them during this season. </p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"> </p>
<h3><strong data-mce-fragment="1">Yellowing Leaves</strong></h3>
<p>This change can be caused by over or under watering, or a response to changes in temperature and light. To address this, adjust your watering routine to the specific needs of each plant and consider moving them to spots where they can receive maximum sunlight during the shorter winter days.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>Brown Leaves</b></h3>
<p>During the winter, brown edges along the leaf are most likely a sign that the air is too dry for your plant. Brown leaves can also mean that the plant is underwatered. Assess the conditions of your environment to know what step you should take next. Keep in mind that if you use indoor grow lights,  they can cause brown leaves if too bright or too close to your plant. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong data-mce-fragment="1">Leaf Drop</strong></h3>
<p>Leaf drop in the winter is most common if your plant is in a drafty area or if the temperature has fluctuated. This is especially common with more sensitive plants like the Fiddle Leaf Fig. Ensure your plant is away from windows, air vents, and doors to the outside during the cold months. For good measure, we recommend also inspecting your plants for <a href="https://feelgrounded.com/blogs/resources/common-plant-pests-how-to-treat-them?_pos=1&amp;_sid=47c342ad6&amp;_ss=r" target="_blank">signs of pests</a>, which are also common during the winter months. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong data-mce-fragment="1">Curled Leaves</strong></h3>
<p>When we use indoor heat sources, like space heaters or central air, the environment becomes drier than our plants prefer. Low humidity leaves can cause leaves to curl. Some plants may also pucker or wrinkle in dry air. Boost humidity with misting, a humidifier, or pebble tray.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong data-mce-fragment="1">Wilting</strong></h3>
<p>Houseplants may show signs of wilting if the air in your home is too dry or if they are not receiving adequate water. Adjust the humidity levels and water your plants as needed. Ensure proper drainage for your pots to prevent waterlogged soil, as this can also contribute to wilting.</p>
<h3>
<br><strong data-mce-fragment="1">Fungal Issues</strong>
</h3>
<p>Winter conditions can be ideal for fungal diseases. Ensure good air circulation around your plants, avoid overcrowding, and be mindful of overwatering. If you notice any signs of mold or fungus, address the issue promptly with appropriate fungicides and adjust your watering routine.</p>
<p><br>The best way to get ahead of winter blues for your plants is to never miss a beat when it comes to their care. Although they require slightly less from you during this rest season, they still need your support! Learn more about winter care <a href="https://feelgrounded.com/blogs/resources/how-to-keep-your-plants-alive-through-the-winter?_pos=1&amp;_sid=2bedcea6a&amp;_ss=r" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>

      <![CDATA[<p>One of the most common questions amongst plant enthusiasts is what type of soil to use. Quality soil nurtures healthy roots, which produce a strong, vibrant plant. We're here to keep you informed and share our favorite soil tip: you can take nearly <em>any </em>potting soil and make it high quality with a few long-lasting amendments!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Whether you're willing to jazz up your next repotting or you simply want to know what to look out for when purchasing commercial potting mix bags, we've got you covered. Explore the variety of soil amendments and their benefits with us below. Your plants will thank you for it!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>THE BASICS</strong></h2>
<p>Amendments serve to benefit your soil in a few key ways, including drainage, aeration, and moisture-retention. Some offer unique nutrients your plant typically won't receive otherwise. Overall, these additions improves the soil structure and better mimics the natural earth that these plants originate from. Their use also extends the longevity of the soil and add to the plant's lifelong health + resilience. Work these amendments into your potting mix, create your own batch to store at home, or build the habit of reading the ingredients on store-bought soil bags. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>SOIL AMENDMENTS</strong></h2>
<p><meta charset="utf-8">About 20-30% of your plant's potting soil should contain healthy additives. Check out our list of recommendations below. You can start out with just having 1-2 on hand at home and add to your collection as you go! </p>
<p> </p>
<strong>Coconut Coir: Promotes Aeration and Moisture Retention</strong><br>
<p>Made from coconut husks, coir enhances soil aeration and water retention. It's an eco-friendly alternative to peat moss, which is currently not sustainable to harvest, and works well in potting mixes for houseplants, promoting optimal root health.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Perlite: Enhances Drainage</strong> <strong>and Aeration</strong></p>
<p>Perlite is a lightweight volcanic glass that aids in soil aeration and drainage. It prevents soil from being too tightly compacted, promoting healthy root systems and reducing the risk of root rot for indoor plants.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Vermiculite: Retaining Moisture and Aeration</strong></p>
<p>Vermiculite is a mineral that improves water retention in potting soil and offers great balance alongside other drainage-enhancing amendments. It's particularly useful for moisture-loving tropical houseplants, ensuring a consistent water supply without the risk of overwatering.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Worm Castings: Nature's Very Own Fertilizer</strong> </p>
<p>Packed with beneficial microorganisms and essential nutrients from the waste of earthworms, castings enhance soil fertility and promote robust plant growth. They're an organic and odor-free way to provide a slow-release fertilizer for your indoor plants.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Activated Charcoal: Filters and Purifies</strong></p>
<p>Activated charcoal, when added to the soil, acts as a natural air purifier. It helps absorb impurities, toxins, and excess moisture, creating a healthier environment for your houseplants. This is especially beneficial in preventing mold growth in the soil, which is common in homes with limited air circulation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Orchid Bark: Improves Aeration, Drainage, and Soil Structure</strong></p>
<p>Bark is chunky and lightweight, adding texture to the soil that allows water and nutrients to flow easily. Mixing bark into your plant's soil creates air pockets of oxygen that prevent soil from becoming tightly compacted. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Sand: Terrific for Drainage and Soil Structure</strong></p>
<p>Sand offers micro pockets of air to assist with soil drainage for any plant while improving the soil structure for roots to easily grow and spread. Sand is a great amendment to balance out moisture-retaining properties within soil. </p>
<ol></ol>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>MORE SOIL TIPS</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Store your opened soil bags in closed containers to prevent pests and bacteria from entering.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Repot plants during spring and summer when they have the most energy.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Check new bags of soil for pests like flying fungus gnats before using it on your plants.</li>
<li>Local gardens may sell compost that you can add to your soil for even greater plant health. </li>
<li>If your planter does not have a drainage hole, add 1-2 inches of pebbles to the base. This offers drainage for excess water to flow away from the roots. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><meta charset="utf-8"><span>Soil quality plays a crucial role in the overall well-being and health of every plant. By incorporating the right soil amendments, you can create an environment that nurtures healthy root systems, optimal nutrient absorption, and vibrant growth. Experiment with these amendments based on your houseplants' specific needs, and watch your indoor oasis flourish.</span></p>

      <![CDATA[<p><strong></strong>Even the most dedicated plant enthusiasts can find their green collection prone to a fungus infestation. Fungus can quickly spread, causing harm above and below the soil, even spreading to nearby plants. Rest easy, we'll guide you through everything you need to know! Learn how to identify, treat, and prevent fungus on your houseplants. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Identifying Fungal Infections</strong></h2>
<p>Once fungi has found a home in one of your plants, it's often visible to the human eye. Fungus is often found on the soil's surface or across leaves. It can also be found below the soil amongst the plant's roots. As soon as you've noticed any of the signs listed below, take action quickly to prevent the fungi from spreading. </p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Fuzzy growth that is white, yellow, or grey</li>
<li>Foul odor coming from the soil, especially when wet</li>
<li>Mold growth</li>
<li>Dark, irregularly-shaped spots on leaves </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Natural Remedies</strong></h2>
<p>These easy treatments can be effective, affordable, and long-lasting when working to rid your beloved greenery of infection. Start with one treatment and try others if you're in need of a new approach. </p>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Neem Oil:</strong> Neem oil is a natural fungicide. Mix with water and spray it on infected plants. It not only kills existing fungus but also prevents future outbreaks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hydrogen Peroxide:</strong> Diluted hydrogen peroxide can treat fungi in the soil or on plant leaves. Mix 1 part 3% Hydrogen Peroxide with 3 parts water and use right away. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Baking Soda Solution:</strong> A solution of baking soda and water (1 teaspoon of baking soda per quart of water) can help control fungal diseases. Spray it on affected plants every 1-2 weeks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cinnamon Powder:</strong> Cinnamon has antifungal properties. Sprinkle cinnamon powder on the soil surface to prevent the growth of fungus.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Recovery and Aftercare</strong></h2>
<p>Once you've started treating your plants, you can take other steps to ensure they make a full recovery without spreading infection to nearby greenery. With correct care, your plants can thrive and grow back even healthier than before. </p>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Isolation:</strong> Remove the infected plant from other healthy plants to prevent the spread of the fungus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trimming:</strong> Prune away severely affected parts of the plant. Disinfect your pruning tools with rubbing alcohol after each cut to avoid spreading the infection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>New Soil: </strong>Fungi in the soil can be easily targeted by repotting your plant in new soil, being sure to rinse off the roots. If you suspect any open bags of soil may be infected, it's best to skip the bag and use brand new soil. Alternatively, you can sanitize soil in the oven using a foil-covered dish at 200º for 30 minutes. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Optimal Conditions:</strong> Ensure your recovered plant receives the right amount of light, water, and nutrients to aid its recovery process.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<h4><strong>Preventing Fungus on Houseplants</strong></h4>
<p>Now that you've figured out how to eliminate fungus on your plants, understand how to prevent the issue from returning. Be sure to spread the word to your friend and family who care for their own greenery. </p>
<p> </p>
<h4><strong>Proper Watering</strong></h4>
<p>Overwatering creates a breeding ground for fungi. Ensure your pots have drainage holes, and water your plants after the top two of soil is dry. If your pot does not have a drainage hole, add 1-2 inches of pebbles at the base of the pot. </p>
<h4><strong>Adequate Air Circulation</strong></h4>
<p>Good airflow prevents moisture from settling on leaves, reducing the risk of fungal growth. Use fans or open windows to promote circulation, especially in humid environments.</p>
<h4><strong>Quarantine New Plants</strong></h4>
<p>Before integrating a new plant into your collection, quarantine it for a few weeks by keeping it a few feet removed from nearby plants. This helps you detect any existing issues before they spread.</p>
<p><strong>Maintain Cleanliness</strong><br>Regularly clean dead leaves and debris from the soil surface. Fungi thrive in decaying organic matter.</p>

<p data-mce-fragment="1">Indoor plants bring life and vibrancy to homes and workplaces, but they aren't immune to problems. One of the most common warnings signs is leaf spots. They tell you that something needs your attention, quick. This blog <span data-mce-fragment="1">explores how to identify leaf spots, what causes them, and most importantly, how to fix the problem.</span></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"> </p>
<h2 data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>What Do Leaf Spots Look Like?</strong></h2>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Leaf spots are discolored areas that appear on the leaves and give off an unhealthy appearance. They vary by size, color, and shape. Leaf spots can be caused by a variety of factors, including fungi, bacteria, and even environmental stressors.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"> </p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">The appearance of the spot can give you a hint as to what the root cause is. Here are the three most common spots you'll see:</p>
<ol data-mce-fragment="1">
<li data-mce-fragment="1">
<strong>Fungal and Bacteria Spots:</strong> These are typically irregular in shape with an outlined border. They may appear in various colors, including brown, black, or yellow, and can be powdery or sticky. Fungal spots often spread in size, and from leaf to leaf. </li>
<li data-mce-fragment="1">
<strong>Environmental Stress Spots</strong>: These spots are commonly uniform in color but range widely in size. They can be dry and crispy or have no change in texture. Spots caused by environmental stressors usually don't have a border.</li>
<li data-mce-fragment="1">
<strong>Water and Nutrient Quality:</strong> Plants that are sensitive to water will develop small spots that are uniform in size and shape. Spotting caused by nutrient deficiencies can take on a similar look. These types of spots are often seen on multiple leaves and can be whitish, brown, or yellow. </li>
</ol>
 Pro Tip: See a yellow halo around the spot? This signals a fungal problem!  </div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1" class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light"> </p>

<h2 data-mce-fragment="1"><strong></strong></h2>
<h2 data-mce-fragment="1"><strong></strong></h2>
<h2 data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>Common Causes </strong></h2>
</div>
<div data-mce-fragment="1" class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light">You'll likely find the cause of leaf spot development on your plants in our list below! Once the cause has been identified, you'll know what should be fixed going forward. </div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1" class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light"> </p>

<div data-mce-fragment="1" class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light"></div>
<div data-mce-fragment="1" class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light"></div>
<div data-mce-fragment="1" class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light">1. Fungal and bacterial infections are caused by:<br>
<ul>
<li>Overwatering</li>
<li data-mce-fragment="1">Contaminated soil or tools</li>
<li data-mce-fragment="1">Poor drainage</li>
<li data-mce-fragment="1">Spread by another plant </li>
<li data-mce-fragment="1">Environmental conditions </li>
<li data-mce-fragment="1">Water-soaked leaves</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
2. Environmental stress is caused by sudden changes in the environment or unsuitable conditions, such as:<br>
<ul>
<li>Warm temperatures</li>
<li>Stagnant air and poor circulation</li>
<li>Excess humidity</li>
<li>Lighting that is too bright or too low</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
3. Water quality and nutrient balance affect the roots directly. Water varies from region to region and not all plants respond with spots!
<ul>
<li>Tap water contains harsh salts and excess minerals</li>
<li>Using distilled water long-term lacks beneficial minerals</li>
<li>Old soil and imbalanced fertilizing </li>
<li>Excess salts are pushed to the surface of the leaf</li>
</ul>
 
<h2 data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>Prevention and Treatment</strong></h2>
Preventing leaf spots is easier than treating them. By simply keeping up with your plant care, you can lessen the chance that issues will develop to cause any spots at all. Here are some tips to keep you on top of it:</div>
<div data-mce-fragment="1" class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light"></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1" class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light"> </p>

<div data-mce-fragment="1" class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light">
<ol data-mce-fragment="1"></ol>
<ol data-mce-fragment="1">
<li data-mce-fragment="1">Proper Environment: Avoid over and underwatering your plants and ensure there is good drainage in the pot. Maintain the right lighting, temperature, and humidity as well. </li>
<li data-mce-fragment="1">Adequate Air Circulation: Ensure good air circulation around your plants by using fans or placing them in rooms with natural airflow.</li>
<li data-mce-fragment="1">Cleanliness: Keep your tools, pots, and the surrounding area clean to minimize the risk of infection. Always disinfect cutting tools before and after use.</li>
<li data-mce-fragment="1">Isolate: Move infected plants away from nearby greenery in the room until the issue is under control. This is a good idea when bringing new plants home, too.</li>
<li data-mce-fragment="1">
<meta charset="utf-8">Pruning: Remove infected leaves promptly to prevent the spread of the disease.</li>
</ol>
 </div>
<div data-mce-fragment="1" class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light">Plants with fungus infestations can be treated with a DIY mixture of 1 part 3% Hydrogen Peroxide and 3 parts water. Use it to spray leaves or pour directly in the soil to treat fungus near the roots. Luckily, most other spots can be fixed with good hygiene, a healthy environment, and attentive care.   </div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of us with a green thumb look forward to the growth we're promised from fertilizing our plants. Spring and summer push out robust leaves and strengthen the plant's health. Fall, on the other hand, is a time when fertilizing should actually stop for your indoor green companions. Let's explore a few reasons why this practice has a preferred timeline: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><b>Growth Slows During Fall and Winter </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fall naturally signals a change in the growth cycle for many plants, even indoors. This means plants shift into reduced growth and energy conservation until spring returns. Treating them with fertilizer during this rest period is disruptive and even damaging. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><b>Risks of Over-fertilization</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some soils contain a small amount of slow-release fertilizer. On top of the last feeding you gave them this summer, there is a risk of over-fertilization if you continue treatments. Excess nutrients in the soil can harm your plants by throwing off the ratio of nutrients, causing malabsorption, and even burning the roots or leaves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><b>Soil Buildup</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continuously fertilizing your indoor plants can lead to a buildup of salts and minerals in the soil. This buildup can be detrimental to plant health, especially as we head into winter when mistakes like over-watering and under-watering are already common. Buildup in the soil affects plant health and the roots' ability to absorb water and nutrients.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><b>Saves Time and Resources</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, ceasing fertilizer treatments indoors is a practical choice that can save you time and supplies. Fertilizers can be costly! Take a break and save the effort for when Spring returns, around early April. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it’s tempting to continue your regular fertilization routine year-round, it's best to allow your plants to naturally adjust to their seasonal changes, promoting long-term health and well-being. Give your indoor collection the break it deserves this fall, and you'll see it thrive when the growing season returns.</span></p>]]>

    <title>Setting Clear Boundaries for Work-Life Balance</title>

      <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The change from one season to another is a perfect time to check in and assess how well you're managing your self-care and boundaries. Most humans can relate to changing energy and mood levels throughout the year. With shorter days, cooler weather, and grinding over the summer, we often want to slow down. As fall and winter creep in, we invite you to pause and reflect on your output thus far and what's in your tank for the remainder of the year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><b>What It Means To Set Boundaries</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boundaries are the limits we set for ourselves to live a life of ideal health, balance, peace, and fulfillment. They help define what we will and will not accept from others, ourselves, and everyday life scenarios. Setting boundaries is a skill that can be practiced and refined at any time. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While your boundaries may involve other people, they’re for you to follow. They often require a degree of commitment and in some cases, the ability to sacrifice personal pleasures and wishes. For example, you might also set a boundary for yourself around a particular goal or hobby, like passing on other opportunities to move the needle forward on a project. If you have a boundary that you won’t work past a certain time, it’s up to you to stick to that regardless of what might be asked of you.   </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to work-life balance and especially new (or renewed) boundaries, preparing for the transition in all directions will equip you for success. We’ve got some tips to stay well along the way!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><b>Anticipate New Conversations</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintaining and enforcing boundaries requires plenty of “no’s” and uncomfortable conversations. Understanding why these new boundaries are important for you and your wellbeing will guide you when you feel tested or need to make a difficult decision. If it feels right for you, feel free to be transparent in conversations about your journey and why the "xyz boundary" is now in place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you tend to feel guilty when putting yourself first, remember that this is about you and your wellbeing. In some ways, boundaries </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">can</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> feel selfish when they're a matter of self-perseverance. They don’t have to disrupt existing relationships and commitments, though. Seek support from a professional mental health expert and your community if you anticipate struggling with maintaining boundaries and relationships. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><b>Create A Space That Makes Both "Shifts" Feel Good </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you commute to a workplace or log on remotely, it's important to craft a space that works for you. Your living space should feel safe, comfortable, and reflective of who you are. A space that suits your many facets, duties, and hobbies seamlessly meshes a realistic work-home balance into your life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a space that allows you to enjoy your leisure time and rest. Likewise, if you work from home, maintaining a dedicated space that maximizes your productivity and keeps your brain engaged is crucial. A home that grants you the freedom to fully "check out" from work responsibilities will empower you to adhere to your personal limits and obtain an ideal balance with fewer obstacles.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><b>Keep Your Values Close </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's easier to follow through on your agreements when they genuinely align with your values. It’s helpful to list the core values that guide your life's decisions and goals, then build boundaries around those principles. Values can shift or transform over time, and the top 3-5 values in your life likely show up at work and home. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A few examples of boundaries that stem from personal values would be:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community + Loyalty <strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> Setting aside one night each week for quality time with family or friends.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sustainable Practices <strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> Turning down projects and shifts outside of your limits.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hard Work Ethic <strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> Prioritizing efficiency + diligence during your workday. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honesty <strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> Speaking your mind when something interferes with your agreements. </span></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, these guiding markers support the journey and lead the way when facing conflict surrounding your needs. Hold them close as you make decisions and navigate new territory. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><b>Find Inspiration In Your Greenery </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">﻿Plants follow natural cycles, even under indoor care. Their changing needs are certain and undeniable. Any caretaker knows firsthand how a plant suffers when steered outside of its parameters. Similarly, when humans forego innate needs and desires, we endure distress at varying levels. Both species are great at adapting to the immediate environment and circumstances. When unchecked, this survival mechanism eventually fails and shows up externally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plants are astoundingly resilient and at the same time, require gentleness and detailed attention. Most houseplants have needs that change with the seasons, just as humans do. Mother nature gives us plenty of validation and inspiration to draw from when we need to figure out how to give ourselves grace as we transform + grow. </span></p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<h2><b>Luck + Prosperity</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plant symbolism has been passed down for generations, varying by culture and time. The Money Tree has held a long-time reputation for attracting prosperity and luck. This is why we often find them thriving inside small businesses and gifted to friends as a housewarming present. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ancient philosophy of Feng Shui would suggest that the Money Tree can be thoughtfully placed in your home to maximize its energy and manifestation power. We'll tell you just where you can place this plant and a few things to consider when taking advantage of its generous symbolism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><b>Define What Wealth Looks Like For You</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wealth has tangible impacts on our reality, including access to health care, quality food, and green spaces. Data shows that green spaces are significantly </span><a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/16fb8000eb3446a9ad83f2a6f11bcc0f"><b>less available in low-income areas</b></a>, and has been linked to health and crime rates<b>. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial wealth secures vital resources for survival and supplies equally important elements of comfort and stability. It's only natural that we would tap into Mother Nature to help bring in this abundance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wealth can also be sought after in terms of happiness, relationships, and health. Knowing what wealth you're hoping to attract will utilize this prosperous energy to the highest capacity. Take some time to define your idea of wealth for your life. From income, to rich relationships, to a surplus of peace, you create the desire. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once your desire is defined, it is easier to begin visualizing how it will show up and positively change your life. Harness this attraction with power by writing these definitions down, digesting media and art that reflects it, incorporating them into your spiritual practice, and believing that you will see them reflected in your own lifestyle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><b>Actionable Steps</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the keys to manifestation and attraction is to embody yourself in the state of wealth you imagine. In your behavior, thoughts, and interactions, showing up in a wealth mindset pushes the vision into reality. An essential step in this embodiment is creating a plan based on what you can control and taking accountable steps to drive your goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Take an intentional inventory of the challenges and weaknesses you’ll face in acquiring the wealth you desire. Note which of these you have some control over with your behaviors or thoughts.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Set reasonable, measurable commitments that will carry you to the next point in your wealth journey. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Share your goals with your community. Friends and family make great practice in declaring your excitement and plans for yourself. Lean into those who encourage you and hold you accountable. Plus, it gives you a chance to accept support from those who believe in you.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> When you need a reminder or pick-me-up, come back to the definition and vision you set for yourself.</span></li>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Feel free to refine that definition and seek support when you need direction.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"><br><br></span>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With all change, give yourself grace for the uncontrollable and trust that you will see yourself through to the other side. Have faith in the blessing that come with tending to your personal growth and happiness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><b>Placement + Use In Your Space</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, just where should you place the Money Tree in your home to attract prosperity, wealth, and luck? We recommend first prioritizing the </span><a href="https://feelgrounded.com/blogs/resources/how-to-care-for-a-money-tree?_pos=2&amp;_sid=fb9b64834&amp;_ss=r"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tropical environment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that your plant needs. Keep in mind that it prefers medium-to-bright, indirect light in a room where it will be remembered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Feng Shui practices, the best way to create harmony with wealth in your life by using objects, energy, and space, is: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>WEALTH</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The southeast corner of your space is most influential for bringing in wealth and prosperity.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>HEALTH:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The centermost area of your space is relevant to blessings in your health.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>CAREER:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The area nearest to your front entrance is believed to bring success in your career. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That's our guide to bringing in the green with your lush Money Tree! Don't forget to take pics of its growth along the way to mark your own milestones.

      <![CDATA[<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Did you know that interacting with soil can put you in a better mood, help your body sleep, and your digestion? All thanks to a friendly bacteria known as </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0376635713000296"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Mycobacterium vaccae,</span></i></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">which lives in the soil around us. Reinforcing the powerful connection between humans and nature, this organism triggers serotonin production, making us healthier + happier humans.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">All that's needed for you to reap these benefits is to spend time around soil. This serotonin boost happens when you're close enough to breathe in the bacteria through the air or absorb it through the skin. Anytime you've had a picnic in the grass or repotted your plants, you've called upon this "happy hormone" to boost your mood. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><b>How Does Serotonin Impact Your Wellbeing?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Serotonin is a big deal when it comes to mental and physical health. This hormone lives in the gut and brain, carried out into the bloodstream. It supports the production of other chemicals as well, like melatonin. Both of these play a crucial role in sleep quality, directly impacting mood, immunity, and health. Serotonin also partners with dopamine, responsible for our feelings of pleasure and motivation. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Given that </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6469458/"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">over 90% of serotonin exists in our GI tract</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">, the hormone is important in digestion and cleaning out the body’s waste. </span><a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/gut-feelings-how-food-affects-your-mood-2018120715548"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Recent studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"> are revealing more and more that what we eat directly affects our mood, even finding connections to symptoms of depression. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">As processed foods, sugars, and chemicals increasingly find their way into daily life, serotonin will continue to play a key part in the maintenance of our physical wellbeing.   </span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><b>What Else Can The Outdoors Do For You?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The power of soil is no surprise alongside the other benefits of outdoor time. Mental clarity, a relaxed nervous system, and reduced anxiety are all rewards of basking in natural spaces. Many studies show that time in green spaces improves our cognitive functions. All the "brain fog", mental blocks, and exhaustion you feel can actually be repaired when you zone out outside. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In modern times, many of us are disconnected from nature, living fast-paced lives in developed areas and cities. When we're deprived of access to natural spaces, there's a <a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/who-benefits-from-nature-in" target="_blank">risk of suffering for generations</a>. For residents and children of metropolitan cities, these spaces provide safety, temperature control, social gatherings, and of course, mental relief for everyone in the community. In a 2022 survey we released to our customers, 92% of respondents reported that spending time in nature had positively improved their mental health, a significant number in any field. We believe everyone should have access to green space, or at least create such a space in their homes. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a way to honor yourself, Earth, and your wellbeing, we encourage you to ground yourself in nature by getting your hands in the soil and breathing in the fresh air as often as you can. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><b>Need Some Inspiration?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Find comfort in knowing that you can support your body and mind by connecting with the living earth around you. Whether it's an accessible spot in your neighborhood or a planned trip, here are some easy ways to receive all the benefits of nature:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Volunteer at a community garden</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Incorporate whole foods and plants in your diet </span></li>

<h2><b>Tip #1 - Assess the Plant's Livelihood Through Leaves and Roots</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When confirming how much life is left in the plant, you'll want to focus on two things: the leaf appearance and the condition of the roots. Leaves offer great insight into the plant's health by displaying signs of fungus, pests, or unmet needs. Roots are vital to a plant's life and thus, if they are in bad shape, the plant will not survive much longer. Depending on the condition of each, there are next steps you can take to save the plant!</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>What to look for:</b></p>
<p><b>Mushy, dark, or foul-smelling roots </b>are s<span style="font-weight: 400;">igns of root rot and fungus, which can be fatal to the plant. Remove unhealthy roots with your hands or using clean scissors and repot the plant. If most of the root system looks this way, you'll want to <a href="https://feelgrounded.com/blogs/resources/propagating-houseplants?_pos=2&amp;_sid=a47fb5c4c&amp;_ss=r" target="_blank">p</a></span><a href="https://feelgrounded.com/blogs/resources/propagating-houseplants?_pos=2&amp;_sid=a47fb5c4c&amp;_ss=r" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ropagate healthy </span>stems and leaves</a> in order<span style="font-weight: 400;"> to save the plant. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Bare stems or fallen leaves </b>are often a sign of unmet needs, though s<span style="font-weight: 400;">ome plants can bounce back from leaf loss with patience and exceptional care. If the root system is healthy, the plant will continue to push out new growth. Issues such as lighting or imbalanced watering should be corrected ASAP. Leaf loss is also common after a change shocks the plant.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Tip #2 - Save Your Dying Plant Through Propagation</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you feel that your plant is beyond recovery or if you need some time to better understand how to care for it, we recommend propagating healthy pieces of your plant. Propagation is an easy method that allows new roots to grow from stems or leaves that have been cut away. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While not every plant can be propagated by stem or leaf cuttings, it's one of the easiest ways to save your greenery and start anew. Some succulents and cacti can grow a new plant simply by placing a healthy leaf in moist soil, encouraging new roots to sprout. Many other propagations can do the same when placed in a glass of clean water for a few weeks. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Popular plants such as the Pothos, Monstera, Maranta, ZZ, and Snake Plants can be propagated in water using stem or leaf cuttings. Learn more about this process by reading through our </span><a href="https://feelgrounded.com/blogs/resources/propagating-houseplants?_pos=2&amp;_sid=90ba88437&amp;_ss=r"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Propagation Guide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some plants can only be propagated by dividing the plants at the roots. In these cases, you'll want to revisit tip #1 above to ensure the roots and greenery are in good enough health to survive.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Tip #3 - Cut Away Damaged and Dead Growth</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When your plant shows signs of deterioration, infestation, or disease, it's best to trim these parts of the plant away. Doing so allows the plant to direct its energy to healthy growth and prevents any possible infection from spreading. Similarly, if your plant has </span><a href="https://feelgrounded.com/blogs/resources/common-plant-pests-how-to-treat-them?_pos=1&amp;_sid=d90f2fae3&amp;_ss=r"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, remove them so it can utilize all of its nutrients. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some plants also benefit from this strategic pruning by pushing out new growth at the site of the cut. From big plants like Fiddle Leaf Figs to smaller plants like the Pothos, stems will be encouraged to branch out in new directions after being cut. Be sure to provide your stressed plant with the best care to help it through!</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Tip #4 - Fertilize for Extra Vigor</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fertilizer helps plants resist disease, build strong cells, and look their best. When your plant is struggling, it's a great idea to offer them a fertilizer treatment. Note that fertilizer is best used monthly during spring and summer. Feeding your houseplants during fall and winter can actually do more harm than good. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feed the soil a dose of diluted fertilizer or make something from home, like </span><a href="https://feelgrounded.com/blogs/resources/natural-fertilizers-for-houseplants?_pos=2&amp;_sid=145a9ea68&amp;_ss=r"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rice Water</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Worm castings are also a great addition to work into the soil for root health. Always follow fertilizer with water and give your plant the best care possible, including making their environment feel like home. If you're caring for a tropical plant, comfortable temperatures and high humidity are crucial for its recovery. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Tip #5 - Be Patient, Healing Doesn't Happen Overnight</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plants are living organisms that need time to recover from periods of stress and poor health. Stay consistent for a few weeks while your plant stabilizes. From there, it may even take months before you see new growth. Your efforts and patience will reward you with a resilient plant or a valuable lesson in your green thumb journey. </span></p>

<p><span>When you're in an emotional dump or stuck in your head, getting out of it can feel impossible. A simple yet powerful solution lies right outside the door: nature. As a reliable healer, it welcomes you with no pressure or expectations, only that you show up and share space as you are. In return, you're presented with a unique environment that allows you to zone out and tune in. </span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Getting outside can be many things: relaxing on a porch, walking to the store, sitting on a park bench, or venturing out on a hike. Each of these has the potential to work wonders for our mental and emotional well-being and offers immediate relief when we need it. Curious how connecting with nature can positively impact your life? We have a few reasons!</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<h2><b>Stress Reduction</b></h2>
<p><b><br></b><span>Natural environments have the remarkable ability to reduce stress and anxiety. Studies have shown that spending time in green spaces, such as parks or forests, can lower cortisol, a key stress hormone that impacts our health. Being surrounded by the sights, sounds, and smells of nature helps us relax, promoting a sense of calmness and tranquility. Whether it's a leisurely walk or a picnic in the park, the outdoors offers a perfect escape from the pressures of daily life.</span></p>
<span></span><br><span></span>
<h2><b></b></h2>
<h2><b></b></h2>
<h2><b></b></h2>
<h2><b></b></h2>
<h2><b>Physical Exercise</b></h2>
<p><span>When we're spending time outdoors, it commonly involves some form of physical movement, which supports a healthy body and mind. Movement releases endorphins, our body's natural mood-enhancing chemical. Exercise can also help manage symptoms of depression and anxiety while boosting self-esteem to create a healthy relationship with yourself. </span></p>
<span></span><br> <span></span>
<h2><b></b></h2>
<h2><b></b></h2>
<h2><b></b></h2>
<b></b>
<h2><b>Improved Mental Functions</b></h2>
<p><span>Research has shown that time outdoors enhances our cognitive function and creativity. Most natural environments have reduced stimulation, allowing our minds to recharge and refocus. This mental rejuvenation can improve concentration, problem-solving skills, and overall mental clarity. So, the next time you find yourself in a creative rut or struggling to concentrate, step outside and let nature ease your mind.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<span></span>

<h2>
<b>Connection with Nature</b><b><br></b><span></span>
</h2>
<p><span>These positive responses from our brains and bodies prove we’re made to be in nature. We encourage you to honor your innate connection with the natural world. It has a way of sending us messages and lessons simply through our senses. Whether we're marveling at a stunning sunset, listening to the soothing sound of a river, or observing the intricate details of a flower, these experiences can make us feel alive. Nothing cures rumination like a beautiful moment of gratitude and perspective.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><b>Trusting In Yourself </b></h2>
<p><span>Getting outside can be uncomfortable or difficult for some. Being exposed, isolated, and on new terrain may feel vulnerable. Feeling this way is okay! When you persist through this new discomfort, you come out of the other side feeling confident in yourself and your abilities. Plus, you're not alone. If you're looking for friendly support while you explore the great outdoors, consider joining like-minded people on the journey. Programs such as </span><a href="https://feelgrounded.com/pages/community"><span>Grounded Hike Club</span></a><span> are designed to be a safe, welcoming space for anyone looking to reconnect with nature. Research what organizations, clubs, and programs exist in your area so you can enjoy some fresh air and Vitamin D. </span></p>

      <![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;">Wondering how to read all the numbers and words on your new <a href="https://feelgrounded.com/products/moisture-meter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moisture Meter</a>? Here's our breakdown on how to use the meter to measure the soil moisture, lighting, and pH levels of your plants. </h3>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>WATER</strong></h2>
<p>To use your Moisture Meter as a way to confirm when to water, follow these steps: </p>
<p> </p>
<p>1. Toggle the black switch on the meter to the "MOIST" setting.</p>
<p>2. Insert the clean meter prongs deep into the pot, more than half way down the pot for an accurate read.</p>
<p>3. The reading is accurate within seconds and should be removed from the soil after 10 minutes to prevent corrosion.</p>
<p>4. Find the "MOIST" line, marked with a scale from "DRY", to "MOIST", to "WET". </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>DRY (1-3)</strong></p>
<p>Cacti and Succulents should be watered once they reach zones moisture zones 1-3. Tropical plants in zones 1-3 are thirsty and should be watered ASAP.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>MOIST (4-7)</strong></p>
<p>Most of our houseplants are tropical and prefer for soil to be consistently moist, within zones 4-7. If they reach zone 4 or lower, go ahead and water them right away!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Marantas: Prefer zones 5-7</p>
<p>Calatheas: Prefer zones 5-7</p>
<p>Alocasias: Prefer zones 4-6</p>
<p>Bird of Paradise: Prefer zones 4-6</p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>Fiddle Leaf Fig: Prerfer zones 4-6</p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>Monsteras: Prefer zones 4-6</p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>Neanthe Palms: Prefer zones 4-6</p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>Pothos: Prefer zones 4-6</p>
<p>Philodendrons: Prefer zones 4-6</p>
<p>Money Tree: Prefer zones 4-6</p>
<p> </p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><strong>WET (8-10)</strong></p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span>Most plants will read as Wet when freshly watered but should move into the Moist section after 1-3 days. If the soil is staying wet for too long, it likely needs better drainage.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>LIGHT</strong></h2>
<p>Similar to the water reading, toggling your meter over to the "LIGHT" setting will assess the level of light your plant is receiving. For this reading, the probes do not need to be inserted into the soil. Instead, you will hold the moisture meter level with the plant's height and face it toward the nearest light source (i.e. a window). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The scale ranges from "DARK" to "LIGHT" with numbers between 0-2000, 2000 being the brightest. Keep in mind that the reading may vary depending on the time of day and the season. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>These plants prefer bright, indirect light, between 700-1500.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fiddle Leaf Fig and other Ficus varieties</li>
<li>Monstera</li>
<li>Bird of Paradise</li>
<li>Ponytail Palm</li>
<li>Aloe Vera</li>
<li>Money Tree</li>
<li>Sansevierias </li>
<li>Cacti varieties </li>
<li>Most succulent varieties </li>
</ul>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p> </p>
<p>These plants are adaptable, even tolerating lower light levels between 250-700.</p>
<ul>
<li>ZZ Plants</li>
<li>Sansevierias </li>
<li>Pothos</li>
<li>Philodendrons</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>These plants do best in medium, indirect light levels, between 500-800.</p>
<ul>
<li>Marantas</li>
<li>Calatheas</li>
<li>Neanthe Palms</li>
<li>Money Tree</li>
</ul>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p> </p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<h2><strong>PH</strong></h2>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>Most plants prefer a pH level between 5.5-6.5, which is slightly acidic. To test your soil's acidity levels, toggle the meter to the "PH" setting and insert the probe down at least half way into the soil. The reading is accurate within about 60 seconds and should be removed within 10 minutes. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>With the exception of some aloes, ferns, and sansevierias, most indoor houseplants suffer once soil becomes alkaline. It's best to research the specific pH needs of each plant and keep fertilizer on hand provide necessary nutrients. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Common Signs That Soil is Too Acidic (0-6.5):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Stunted growth</span></li>
<li><span>Brown leaf spots</span></li>
<li><span>Twisted, warped leaves</span></li>
<li>Green veins on a yellow leaf </li>
<li>Red and purple leaf development  </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Common Signs That Soil is Too Alkaline (7.5-14): </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Yellow veins on leaves</span></li>
<li><span>Broken or brown tips on new growth</span></li>
<li><span>Wilted leaves</span></li>
<li><span>Stunted growth</span></li>
<li>Red and purple leaf development  </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>Ingredients in fertilizer can affect the acidity of the soil. Nitrogen is one of the main minerals that makes the soil more acidic. When in doubt, research the soil and pH needs of your specific plant!</p>
